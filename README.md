# C/C++ University Programming Project Collection
A collection of all the C code projects I've worked on during university.\
Thank you to Dr. Bahamon for providing these lessons and teaching my the basics of C and C++.

## How to Read Through this Repository
Every file in this repository is a small project to create a program for a specific problem. Click on an file to look through the code and follow along with the comments to understand what problem is being solved! 

### Final Notes
Let me know if creating separate folders for each projects and including individual READMEs would be a better way to present these projects. I am always open to feedback and learning!

Many of these projects are related to math and science programming problems, I hope to work on similar thought provoking and challenging problems in my future.
